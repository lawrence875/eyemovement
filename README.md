# eyemovement_classification_based_on_GMMHMM
This program is based on Python. Before running the program, you need to download the following modules:hmmlearn, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits
We provide the test data of the program——collect_clasi_train.txt. The txt file contains the eye movement data we collected. There are three columns of data in the file. The first two columns are the eye movement position coordinates x and y, and the third column is the calculated speed. Their units are all normalized coordinates.Users can run main.py to implement GMM-HMM hierarchical algorithm to classify eye movement data.
Thank you for using this program.
